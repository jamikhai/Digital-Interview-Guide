\maketitle

\section*{Purpose}
This guide has been created to help you prepare for digital hardware interviews
(ASIC/FPGA) at a level expected from a recent graduate of a Computer
Engineering undergraduate program. It covers combinational/sequential logic,
HDL (Verilog/SystemVerilog), microarchitecture, timing analysis, and more.
Interview rounds, especially for full-time positions at larger companies, may
cover each or all of these topics, depending on the role. From my experience,
expect earlier rounds to be a technical focus with verbal explanation and
coding exercises, and more design whiteboarding and resume questions as the rounds go
on.

Disclaimer: Some questions adapted from Harris \& Harris \cite{Harris2021}.
This resource is purely for educational and learning purposes.

% Preparation Insights
%=============================
\section{Preparation Insights}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Know Your Resume:} Be prepared to discuss everything
    listed such as projects, tools, and responsibilities, at both high and detailed
    levels, including drawing a block diagram of your project while talking
    through it.

    \item \textbf{Cross-Functional Readiness:} Expect comprehensive questions
    that may span verification, design, and software/firmware interaction.
    Interviewers often assess system-level understanding beyond RTL and
    understanding of good design practices.

    \item \textbf{Problem Solving Focus:} Interviewers value your approach and
    reasoning more than just getting the right answer. Communicate your thought
    process clearly and consider trade-offs. Practice explaining your thought
    process during problems, and don't be afraid to ask for a moment to think
    or ask to clarify assumptions. This demonstrates critical thinking and
    ensures you fully understand the problem before solving it.

    \item \textbf{Master the Fundamentals:} Ensure a strong understanding of
    core digital design concepts such as pipelining, FSMs, combinational and
    sequential logic, and memory addressing. Often an interviewer will ask you
    to explain a concept before you do a design exercise with it.

    \item \textbf{PPA and Timing} Be ready to discuss Power-Performance-Area
    (PPA) tradeoffs, Clock Domain Crossing (CDC), timing, and low-power
    strategies. Be well-versed in setup and hold times, clock skew, on-chip
    variations, power consumption, metastability, and timing paths. Once again,
    relate thought processes and design choices to Power, Performance, and
    Area.

    \item \textbf{RTL Design Topics:} Practice implementing sequence detectors,
    understand the difference between Mealy and Moore machines, and be able to
    write clear, synthesizable RTL. Know that an RTL testbench is just as
    important as the module itself. Understanding the simulation tool and
    reading waveforms is essential.

    \item \textbf{Leverage Your Experience:} Be able to explain your past
    roles, design challenges, and key decisions. Reflect on what you learned
    and how you grew from those experiences. Show humility and a willingness to
    learn from mistakes. Do your best to be charismatic and personable, as
    interviewers are also evaluating if they want to work with you.

    \item \textbf{Don't Rely on AI:} Study for interviews as you would for an
    exam, as you will not have access to AI tools during the interview. While
    AI can be a helpful tool for learning, it should not replace your own
    understanding and problem-solving skills.
